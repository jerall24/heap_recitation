Dynamic Memory Recitation - 12/04/2020

Type in 'make' in the terminal which will clobber all of the files and recompile them.  

Afterwards run ./main to get the output. Comments are in main.c and linked_node.c


Thank you to my trusty recitation crew for showing up each week, it's been an honor to work with you this semester. Good luck in the Spring semester!
